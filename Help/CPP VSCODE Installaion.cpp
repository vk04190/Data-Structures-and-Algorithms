// Install Visual Studio Code.

// Install the C++ extension for VS Code.

// Install Mingw-w64<http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds> to a folder that has no spaces in its path (in other words, NOT the default location of C:/Program Files/). In this tutorial, we assume it is installed under C:\Mingw-w64.

//  Download link of MinGW64 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe/download>

// Add the path to your Mingw-w64 bin folder to the Windows PATH environment variable.

    // Go to your Windows OS Settings and search for Edit environment variables for your account.
    // Choose the Path variable and then select Edit.
    // Select New and add the Mingw-w64 path to the system path. The exact path depends on which version of Mingw-w64 you have installed and where you installed it. Here is an example: c:\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-win32-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin.
    // Select OK to save the Path update. You will need to reopen any console windows for the new PATH location to be available.
